## Flow
### Pre-project Planning
For project 3 I decided to make an adventure text based game in Python using the command line. 

Once I decided this I typed the story out on windows notepad and within the layout of the story the process of if else statements nested within eachother began to become clear to follow.

### Beginning story
If the user types "yes", they are asked to enter their name and so the story begins. If the user chooses not to enter any name, a default name is provided.

If the user types "no", a goodbye message is displayed.
